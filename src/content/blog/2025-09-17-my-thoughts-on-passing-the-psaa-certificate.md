## What is PSAA?
PSAA is the acronym of Practical SOC Analyst Asociate certificate, a associate-level certification in security operations and incident response done by TCM Security. It is mainly focused on a practical skills, it's course contains more than 30h of content in video format.

## My Thoughts

Recently I passed the exam of PSAA! It's my first cybersecurity related certification so I don't have much experience in other similar courses, but right now I'm also doing the Security Analyst Level 1 (SAL1) certificate course by TryHackMe so it can give me a bit more context. 

I really liked the course, I already have a strong background in Computer Engineering so it made things easier I think. However I liked how everything it's explained by the teacher of the course `Andrew Prince`, I consider that the content it's really useful and also it's well explained.
The videos of the course provide a theoretical content and also hands-on practice to follow along so you can understand how thing are done and why, the course also provide some CTF to practice your skills learned.
In my case I also did a big part of the SAL1 course that it also gived me more theoretical content and also more practice, not only that I also did some more CTF in THM, Cyberdefenders and HTB before taking the exam
