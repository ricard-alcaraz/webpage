In this first post I would like to explain the purpouse of this webpage.

I want to use this webpage to document all the things I like and find interesting. Currently Im learning about blue team cybersecurity, and since I find useful to document all the process I do while solving a lab, I thought that it would be great to share it in my webpage.

So I want to use this website as a CV and also to share things in this blog.

Thanks for reading!
